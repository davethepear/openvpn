open explorer (not Internet Explorer)
put \\192.168.1.100 into the address bar
username & password is user & user
it's probably best if you map the drives (Windows)
right click on Composition, Map as Network Drive...
        Composition > N
        Distribution > O
        Public > P
        Proofing > Q
        "Big Drive" > R
        Printshop > S

The printer driver is here:
R:\Programs & Drivers\LJM607-M608-M609_Full_WebPack_43.3.2511.exe

it'll get mad and say it can't find the printer, then it will ask for
the IP of the printer: 192.168.1.221

I don't know if you'll need other printers, if you do, let Jackie know.
